[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting...

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold, all over my arm
I don't wanna know, baby
I don't wanna know, no, no
I don't wanna know, baby
I don't wanna know, no, no

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I don't wanna know the truth
I don't wanna know the truth
I don't wanna know the truth
I don't wanna know the truth

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran / Eminem]
But you look so good, yeah, you look so fine
And I'm here to remind you what you're leaving behind
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
I don't wanna know the way it ends
I don't wanna know the way it ends
I don't wanna know the way it ends
I don't wanna know the way it ends

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I don't wanna know the truth
I don't wanna know the truth
I don't wanna know the truth
I don't wanna know the truth

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran / Eminem]
But you look so good, yeah, you look so fine
And I'm here to remind you what you're leaving behind
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

[Bridge: Eminem]
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go is my shot
Feet fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got

[Verse 3: Eminem]
You can do anything you set your mind to, man
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

[Outro: Ed Sheeran / Eminem]
You better lose yourself...
I don't wanna know, baby
I don't wanna know, no, no
You better lose yourself...
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
