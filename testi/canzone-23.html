[Verse 1]
I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a Lego house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
But there's one thing on my mind
It's all for you

[Chorus]
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend ya
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

[Verse 2]
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

[Chorus]
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend ya
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

[Bridge]
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And color you in
If things go right we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

[Chorus]
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend ya
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

[Outro]
Don't hold me down
I think your braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend ya
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
