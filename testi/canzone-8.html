[Verse 1]
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But, darling, stay with me

[Chorus]
Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But, darling, stay with me

[Verse 2]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But, darling, stay with me

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

[Outro]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But, darling, stay with me
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But, darling, stay with me
