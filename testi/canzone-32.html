[Intro: The Weeknd]
You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it can set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
You are not the single type, so baby, this the life
Hold me tight and don't let go
You are not the single type, so baby, this the life
Hold me tight and don't let go

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Girl, I understand you've been hurting from another man
I know you're scared to let me show you who I am
You don't have to worry, I ain't gonna do you no harm
All these other girls, they're just a fan to me
I'm just tryna get to you, girl, but you're taking it too far
Don't you be scared to fall in love again

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
You are not the single type, so baby, this the life
Hold me tight and don't let go
You are not the single type, so baby, this the life
Hold me tight and don't let go

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
And I know you're scared
But I've been there, I can set you free
No more lonely nights, don't it sound so nice?
You have my heart, don't you see?

[Outro: The Weeknd]
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
