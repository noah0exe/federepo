[Intro]
Yeah, ah

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna give you every second, second
You just be begging, beggin' for attention
My affection is a weapon in my arsenal
You want my all, baby, don't you stall

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't need to read the writing on the wall
I ain't here to waste no time, no time
How I do it in the field? I take a knee and pray
Knowin' God is on my side when I hit the stage
I've been waitin' on your love

[Chorus]
I've been waitin' on your love
I've been waitin' on your love, I
I've been waitin' on your love
I've been waitin' on your love, I
I've been waitin' on your love, oh, oh, oh
I've been waitin' on your love

[Verse 2]
I ain't wastin' any time with my lover
Wanna make you mine, undercover
I'm done with the games, tired of the lies
You can see it in my eyes, I got no disguise

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't need to read the writing on the wall
I ain't here to waste no time, no time
How I do it in the field? I take a knee and pray
Knowin' God is on my side when I hit the stage
I've been waitin' on your love

[Chorus]
I've been waitin' on your love
I've been waitin' on your love, I
I've been waitin' on your love
I've been waitin' on your love, I
I've been waitin' on your love, oh, oh, oh
I've been waitin' on your love

[Bridge]
I've been waitin' on your love
I've been waitin' on your love
Oh, I've been waitin' on your love
Oh, I've been waitin' on your love

[Chorus]
I've been waitin' on your love
I've been waitin' on your love, I
I've been waitin' on your love
I've been waitin' on your love, I
I've been waitin' on your love, oh, oh, oh
I've been waitin' on your love

[Outro]
I've been waitin' on your love
I've been waitin' on your love
I've been waitin' on your love
I've been waitin' on your love
