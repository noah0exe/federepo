Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
        
[Verse 1]
We couldn't turn around
'Til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now 
But know I ain't too proud 
Even when I tried 
You don't believe it
We do this every time 
Seasons change and our love went cold

[Chorus]
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Bridge]
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
'Cause I don't have time for the games you play

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Outro]
Run away, run away, run away
Run away, run away, run away
Run away, run away, run away
