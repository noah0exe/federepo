[Intro]
Very superstitious, writing's on the wall
Very superstitious, ladders 'bout to fall
Thirteen-month-old baby, broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past

[Verse 1]
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way

[Verse 2]
Very superstitious, wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem, do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream, keep me goin' strong
You don't wanna save me, sad is my song

[Chorus]
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way, yeah, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Very superstitious, nothin' more to say
Very superstitious, the devil's on his way
Thirteen-month-old baby, broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, good things in your past

[Chorus]
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way

[Outro]
Very superstitious, writing's on the wall
Very superstitious, ladders 'bout to fall
Thirteen-month-old baby, broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past
