[Verse 1]
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

[Chorus]
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start

[Verse 2]
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

[Chorus]
Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

[Bridge]
Oh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
Ah-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
