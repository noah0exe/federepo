[Verse 1]
Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

[Verse 2]
Backbeat, the word was on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

[Chorus]
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how

[Verse 3]
Because maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all, you're my wonderwall

[Verse 4]
Today was gonna be the day, but they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

[Chorus]
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how

[Outro]
I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all, you're my wonderwall
I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all, you're my wonderwall
I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me
