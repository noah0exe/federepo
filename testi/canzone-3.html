[Intro]
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Never had much faith in love or miracles
Never wanna put my heart on the line
But swimming in your water is something spiritual
I'm born again every time you spend the night

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
Yeah, you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, yeah, yeah
You make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven for too long

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
Yeah, you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, yeah, yeah
You make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven for too long

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
'Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
Yeah, you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, yeah, yeah
You make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven for too long

Too long, too long, too long
