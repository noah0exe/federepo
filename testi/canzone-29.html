[Verse 1]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did

[Pre-Chorus]
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

[Chorus]
And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them

[Verse 2]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be

[Chorus]
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

[Bridge]
Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know

[Chorus]
And now when all is gone
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

[Verse 3]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be

[Chorus]
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

[Outro]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did
