[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Bad ass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that's it)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And I see you (Oh)
The way I breathe you in (In)
It's the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby
Never let you go, oh

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Bad ass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that's it)

[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
I get the feeling, so I'm sure (Sure)
Hand in my hand because I'm yours
I can't, I can't pretend, I can't ignore you're right for me
Don't think you wanna know just where I've been, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Don't be scared, I ain't goin' nowhere
Won't you follow me? I'm not gonna follow you
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Daniel Caesar]
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Bad ass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that's it)

[Verse 3: Giveon]
I get my peaches down in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Bad ass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that's it)

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Giveon]
Something about it, just feels so right (So right)
In the morning and late at night (Late at night)
Smooth like butter, gonna change your mind (Change your mind)
When I'm with you, everything is alright (Alright)
No, no, no

[Chorus: Justin Bieber, Giveon & Daniel Caesar]
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Bad ass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that's it)

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
Peaches, peaches
Peaches, peaches, peaches
Peaches, peaches
Peaches, peaches, peaches
