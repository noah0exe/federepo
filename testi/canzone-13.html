[Intro]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Verse 1]
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

[Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Verse 2]
I'm not just trying to get you back on me
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Bridge]
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

[Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Outro]
I'm not just trying to get you back on me
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
