[Intro: The Kid LAROI]
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still
I realize the time that I wasted here
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
Oh, I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Oh, oh-oh
When I'm away from you, I miss your touch
You're the reason I believe in love
It's been difficult for me to trust
And I'm afraid that I'ma fuck it up
Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded
'Cause you ain't ever left me empty-handed
And you know that I know that I can't live without you
So, baby, stay

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI & Justin Bieber]
I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still
I realize the time that I wasted here
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
Oh, I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

[Post-Chorus: The Kid LAROI, Justin Bieber]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

[Verse 2: The Kid LAROI]
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
I don't like it when you're away, oh-oh
I don't like it when you're away
I don't like it when you're out of sight
And I don't like it when you're out of town
I don't like it when you're not around

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI & Justin Bieber]
I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still
I realize the time that I wasted here
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
Oh, I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

[Post-Chorus: The Kid LAROI, Justin Bieber]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

[Outro: The Kid LAROI]
I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here
