[Intro]
Let's take our time tonight, girl
Above us all the stars are watchin'
There's no place I'd rather be in this world

[Verse 1]
Your eyes are where I'm lost in
Underneath the chandelier
We're dancin' all alone
There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside
Right now

[Pre-Chorus]
So, baby, let's just turn down the lights
And close the door
Ooh, I love that dress
But you won't need it anymore
No, you won't need it no more

[Chorus]
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl

[Verse 2]
I unzip the back to watch it fall
While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No, don't be afraid to show it all
I'll be right here ready to hold you
Girl, you know you're perfect from
Your head down to your heels
Don't be confused, baby
It's just me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
So, baby, let's just turn down the lights
And close the door
Ooh, I love that dress
But you won't need it anymore
No, you won't need it no more

[Chorus]
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl

[Bridge]
There's something 'bout the way you look tonight
Something that I just can't describe
But whatever it is, you make me feel
Like I'm a man, I'm a man
And if tonight is our last night alive
Then I wanna do it right, yeah

[Chorus]
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl

[Outro]
Take it off, baby
Take it off, baby
Versace on the floor
Take it off, baby
Take it off, baby
Versace on the floor
