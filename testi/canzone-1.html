[Strofa 1]
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

[Verse 1]
Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful, uh
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know, when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

[Ritornello]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah

Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, uh
And I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother askin' if you look okay
You know I'll say

[Chorus]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

[Bridge]
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
[Chorus]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah
