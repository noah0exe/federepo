[Verse 1]
Spent 24 hours, I need more hours with you
You spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent the late nights making things right between us
But now it's all good, babe
Roll that backwood, babe
And play me close

[Chorus]
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sundown, when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need a girl like you

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sundown, when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
I spent last night on the last flight to you
Took a whole day up trying to get way up, ooh
We spent the daylight trying to make things right between us
And now it's all good, babe
Roll that backwood, babe
And play me close

[Chorus]
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sundown, when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah

[Verse 4]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need a girl like you

[Bridge]
I need a girl like you
Yeah, I need a girl like you
Yeah, I need a girl like you

[Chorus]
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sundown, when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need a girl like you
