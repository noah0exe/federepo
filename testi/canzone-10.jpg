[Verse 1]
They told me I was out there
Tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones
Showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me I'm too crazy
Love me or they leave me
'Cause I won't apologize for the light in my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
But they don't know what I know
'Cause my pain made me grow
And they don't say what I say
'Bout the God who makes a way

[Chorus]
And I remember when they said I wouldn't make it far
When they said I'd never have the keys to the car
When they told me that the day would never come
You still gave me daisies
Daisies in a bulletproof vest
And when they said my name, you said it with respect
When they tried to burn me down, you were all I had left
You still gave me daisies
Daisies in a bulletproof vest

[Verse 2]
I know that life could be so crazy
I know that love could make you lose your mind
And I know that people try to change you
From the outside in, but they can't define

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause they don't know what I know
'Cause my pain made me grow
And they don't say what I say
'Bout the God who makes a way

[Chorus]
And I remember when they said I wouldn't make it far
When they said I'd never have the keys to the car
When they told me that the day would never come
You still gave me daisies
Daisies in a bulletproof vest
And when they said my name, you said it with respect
When they tried to burn me down, you were all I had left
You still gave me daisies
Daisies in a bulletproof vest

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You still gave me daisies
Daisies in a bulletproof vest

[Chorus]
And I remember when they said I wouldn't make it far
When they said I'd never have the keys to the car
When they told me that the day would never come
You still gave me daisies
Daisies in a bulletproof vest
And when they said my name, you said it with respect
When they tried to burn me down, you were all I had left
You still gave me daisies
Daisies in a bulletproof vest

[Outro]
You still gave me daisies
Daisies in a bulletproof vest
